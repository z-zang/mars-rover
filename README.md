# Mars rover project

```
npm install
```

```
npm start
```

TODO/ideas
- store co-ords in object rather than array, for greater readability
- ! add exit command, to quit program (instead of ctrl-c)
- add tests
- isolate digit regex testing as a function

Future considerations:
- could add z-index, for height of arm
- name rovers (and store in object)
- move rovers again
- number input: choose base other than 10 (found when trying typeof Number('23a') === true)
